            <h2>DogBot</h2>
            <p>This is a bot for social media chats (namely, facebook). I contributed to it by adding a module that mirrors the functionality of my <a href="/tools/uwu">UwU Translator</a></p>
            <p class="adj">It is in a private repository, it requires multiple parts, and it is still a work in progress.</p>

            <h2>Spruce</h2>
            <p>This is an unfinished game that a team and I worked on over a summer break. It uses very few libraries to allow us to build basic features from scratch.</p>
            <p class="adj">It is not currently in a playable state, but it does demonstrate many coding techniques that have some utility, and changes are occasionally made to this day.</p>

            <h2>I Like Monster Math</h2>
            <p>This project was a bot for the website reddit, which contributed to a site-wide joke from 2017/06/13 to 2017/06/29.</p>
            <p>Whenever someone commented "They did the math" (in reference to an act of math-doing), a bot owned by another user would reply "don't fucking say it". This program would then reply to that comment with "they did the monster math" (in reference to <a href="https://youtu.be/AxcM3nCsglA">this song</a>).</p>
