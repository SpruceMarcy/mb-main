			<h1>About the site</h1>
			<p>This site is designed to be a catch-all for everything I might want to have hosted on the internet.</p>
            <p>It is very much in development at this moment in time. It is hosted on heroku right now because I don't have internet access that allows me to set up a web server. Hopefully this will change in the coming year, but until then, you can find it here.</p>
