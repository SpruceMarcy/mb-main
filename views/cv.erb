                <p><strong>March 2019 - Present: mxmbrook.co.uk</strong></p>
                <p>Created a personal website using the Rack-based Ruby framework Sinatra.</p>
                <p>Provided direct experience in many aspects of web development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the front end, I have written all of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the site, particularly taking into account UX principles to do so.</li>
                    <li>In the back end, I have written both a controller (as the site uses an MVC pattern) and multiple non-ruby tools that visitors can use.</li>
                    <li>I hosted the site via a cloud hosting provider, and connected it to a PostgreSQL database for storing content.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using this setup rather than a static site, such as those provided by GitHub pages, has given me much more control over the functionality of the site, and as a result has allowed me to heavily experiment with web technology.</p>

                <p><strong>November 2019: HackSheffield5 Project</strong></p>
                <p>During a 24-hour hackathon, two other team members and I worked on a Python application designed to determine whether an email was fraudulent.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used Machine Learning models trained on datasets of example phishing and scam emails to make the determination.</li>
                    <li>Learned how to work with IMAP servers and parse .eml files.</li>
                    <li>Designed and implemented a robust web interface using the Python micro web framework Flask.</li>
                    <li>Took on the role of managing the small team in order to complete the project within the limited timeframe and best utilise our individual specialities.</li>

                <p><strong>January 2019: Global Engineering Challenge</strong></p>
                <p>Worked with a multidisciplinary team of students over the course of a week to design a practical engineering solution to problems faced by the population of rural India.</p>
                <p>We chose to research potential software solutions to replace rudimentary financial systems used by self-help groups.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication was key in this challenge. Besides having to coordinate our efforts between researching and creating a report, our solution required perspectives from each of our fields.</li>
                    <li>The challenge heavily featured presentation skills, as we needed to communicate our ideas to other participants and professionals as a team several times.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the end of the challenge, we presented a solution that considered feasibility, cost, and a variety of regional limitations to Sheffield University alumni and local industrial engineers to be assessed.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <div class="indent">
                <p><strong>March 2019 - Present: Sheffield Assassins Society, Inclusion Officer</strong></p>
                <p>I am currently on the committee of a University of Sheffield society. I ensure that inclusion is taken into consideration in all society activities. This involves making students feel welcome, and being the direct contact for students who may face barriers to participation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I regularly communicate with other committee members as part of arranging society events and games, especially as each responsibility is often partially dependant on progress made by other people on the committee.</li>
                    <li>I engage with society members both in and out of events to help find new ways for the society to maximise enjoyment and participation by students.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Oct 2018 - Jun 2019: Oxfam, Retail Volunteer</strong></p>
                <p>Served customers in an Oxfam bookshop on weekends. I was also responsible for sorting and handling books of all categories and genres.</p>
                <p><strong>Jul 2017 - Sep 2018: St. Michael's Hospice, Retail Volunteer</strong></p>
                <p>Volunteered weekly at a charity retail store.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Served and assisted customers with their queries.</li>
                    <li>Sorted donated stock, and managed the displays of the shop.</li>
                    <li>Handled IT issues with a till and the shop's office computer.</li>
                    <li>Implemented an organisation system for the shop's stock of CDs, DVDs, and books based on a pigeonhole sort, which was adopted by the shop's manager.</li>
                    <li>Worked with other volunteers to fairly and effectively distribute the daily workload.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> In October 2017, my work at this shop was Highly Commended under the "Young Volunteer of the Year" category at the Harrogate & District Volunteering Awards, for consistently fulfilling my responsibilities without problems, and assisting in the management of the store to a limited extent.</p>
